# Zak's Ztorg

![licence](https://img.shields.io/badge/licence-GPL--3.0-important)

This is My First Attempt to have something remotely big Project.

- Its a tile-based terminal game.
- The Source Code is Made to be Independent. I'll release a more Refined Library which is not tied w/ ztorg In Future. But if You are fairly competent in programming. You can use my source and modify however you like.
- Its more of a Demo rather than a game.
