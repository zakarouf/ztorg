# Zak's Ztorg

This is My First Attempt to have something remotely big Project
And As of Uploading this Repo to Github (5th May 2020), I have only
been coding for few months. I just wanted to do something in Quarentine
So I Decided to learn basic programming. This is the it.

### Installation & Execution

For Installing it just run
```
./compile
```
And it Should Compile the binary current directory named 'ztorg'
It can be executed by
```
./ztorg
```
#### IF ANYONE READING THIS

IF you wonder upon this repo please send me the ways I can Improve
I'm not a CS student and Am self learning most of my stuff.

Cheers !!!
