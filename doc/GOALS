There are set of Goals I've set to before starting on this project which are:

    - The Entire Program (binary i.e not including assets) will not be more than
      1 Megabyte in Size.

    - It will Provide Infinite and random Map Generation.
    
    - Player, NPCs, Entities will be fully supported.
