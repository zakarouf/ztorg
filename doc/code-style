How I Code Ztorg

Function Name:
    
    I name fuction starting with the their scope and where they reside.
    For Example:
    If a Function exist in path:

    zse/
        |- color/
                |- color.c

    Then I'll simply start with zse_color_(1)_(2)..
    Here (1) = If Its a child of a funtion then the functions name
    And  (2) = What It does(in a word or two)

    If its a static funtion then I dont usally specify the:
    But i always put a underscore in front of it to specify its a static fuction.

    Example of Function I used in Ztorg:
        zse_map_export_st()

            The name alone tells us the function is in zse distribution family
            and is part of map library.
            Then it tells us what it Does?
                (Export) name under map library can only mean that it exports map
                while `st` tells us that the func has more specific citeria i.e 
                exorting static style maps(non infinite maps in zse).
